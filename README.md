Orchard PowerShell Project
=========

This is the home page of the Orchard PowerShell project - a PowerShell-based management shell for websites running on Orchard.

The aim of this project is to provide a shell and scripting environment which enables users to perform all tasks which can be performed from either the current Orchard CLI (orchard.exe) and the Orchard Admin (and even more!).

See User's Guide for information on how to set up and run OrchardPs with your Orchard website.

If you are a software developer, feel free to fork the codebase and play with it. Code contributions are welcome! See the Developer's Guide for more details on building and debugging OrchardPs.
